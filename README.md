# 🌡️ Glucose Prediction using Heart Disease Dataset

This project uses the **Framingham Heart Disease dataset** to predict blood glucose levels through regression models.  
Both **Linear Regression** and **Decision Tree Regressor** are trained and evaluated.  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature importance visualization, and model performance comparison are included.

## 🧪 Features:
- Cleaned & preprocessed dataset
- Correlation heatmap
- Glucose distribution and scatterplots
- Linear vs Decision Tree regression
- Model comparison (MSE, R²)
- Feature importance (from Decision Tree)

## 📁 Dataset:
Framingham Heart Study dataset — originally used for cardiovascular risk prediction, repurposed here for glucose level regression.

## 📊 Models Used:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor

## 📈 Metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
